```openai
Show me a very simple rust function
```

Sure, here's an example of a simple Rust function. This function takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum:
```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}
fn main() {
    let result = add(5, 7);
    println!("The sum is {}", result);
}
```
```output
The sum is 12
```
```mojo
#file: cool.mojo

print("wow sweet one")
```
```output
wow sweet one
```

This `add` function has a descriptive name, and it's clear from the parameter list and the return type that the function adds two i32 integers together.
